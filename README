Design a Roman Numerals Converter Console Application

üóíÔ∏è  The Brief
We would like you to create a Roman Numerals Converter Console Application using the Java programming language. To create your console application, we would like you to create a Maven project (using IntelliJ) and push your repository to GitHub.

User Story
As a user
I would like to use the Roman Numerals Converter Console Application
So that I can convert my roman numerals into numbers


‚úÖ   User Acceptance Criteria
When building products, it is useful to define and work towards a set of acceptance criteria to ensure that we have captured the user requirements and features correctly. A helpful framework is GIVEN, WHEN, THEN. For your console application, we would like you to satisfy the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN
The user starts the console application and is prompted with the message Please enter a Roman Numeral

WHEN
The user enters the roman numeral I

THEN
The application will print the conversion to the console, in this case, You converted the Roman Numeral I to the number 1


GIVEN
The user starts the console application and is prompted with the message Please enter a Roman Numeral

WHEN
The user enters the roman numeral II

THEN
The application will print the conversion to the console, in this case, You converted the Roman Numeral II to the number 2


We would like you to convert the Roman Numerals for numbers 1 to 10. You are more than welcome to convert more Roman Numerals if you wish but this is not a core requirement.

Unit Testing
We would like you to add some unit tests using the JUnit 5 unit testing framework.
